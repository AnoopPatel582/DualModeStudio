## Key Features

### Video Embedding
The site supports three video source types with automatic detection and correct rendering:

- **YouTube** — Detected via `isYouTubeUrl()`. Share links and `watch?v=` URLs auto-converted to embed format via `toYouTubeEmbedUrl()`.
- **Vimeo** — Detected via `isVimeoUrl()`. Share links (`vimeo.com/{id}?share=copy`) auto-converted to player embed URLs (`player.vimeo.com/video/{id}`) via `toVimeoEmbedUrl()`.
- **Direct MP4** — Cloudinary-hosted MP4 files rendered via `<video>` tag with autoplay, mute, and loop.
- **Images** — Static image files rendered via `<img>` tag (used for thumbnails in the portfolio).

All video cards are non-interactive overlays (pointer-events disabled) with click-to-modal behaviour. The **VideoModal** component opens the video full-size with autoplay enabled.

### Animations & Interactions
- **Framer Motion** — Word-by-word stagger animation on the Hero headline and subheading; scroll-triggered `whileInView` reveals on sections.
- **ScrollReveal** — Wrapper component using Framer Motion `whileInView` to fade/slide sections in on scroll.
- **Glow Cards** — CSS `@property` + `conic-gradient` animated border with a rotating glow sweep effect (`borderSpin` keyframe).
- **Marquee** — CSS keyframe marquee animations (`animate-marquee-left` / `animate-marquee-right`) for the trust logos and feedback screenshots.
- **Navbar** — Fixed, frosted-glass (`backdrop-blur-md bg-black/80`) with animated mobile hamburger → X transition and an AnimatePresence-powered dropdown.

### Contact System
- Form fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Message.
- Client-side email validation via `validator.js`.
- Server-side submission via `/api/contact` (Next.js API Route) using the **Resend** email SDK.
- Success/error states shown inline without page reload.

### Navigation
- Active-section-aware smooth scrolling via `scrollToSection()`.
- `ScrollToHash` — a client component that reads `window.location.hash` on mount and scrolls to the correct section, enabling cross-page anchor deep links (e.g. `/portfolio` → `/#contact`).
- WhatsApp CTA button in the navbar links directly to the studio's WhatsApp number: `+91 88009 46239`.
- **Calendly** integration for booking strategy sessions: `calendly.com/business-dualmodestudio/strategy-session`.

### Design System

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Background | `#000000` (pure black) |
| Foreground | `#ffffff` |
| Primary | `hsl(204, 100%, 50%)` — electric sky blue |
| Body Font | Inter (Google Fonts) |
| Display Font | Syne (Google Fonts) — used for all headings |
| Base text opacity | `text-white/60` — `text-white/80` |
